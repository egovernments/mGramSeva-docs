# User Onboarding - Bulk Upload

The user of the GP system is onboarded by loading user records in bulk as a backend activity. The system enables the loading of user records in bulk and creates the profiles with a mobile number as login id and with a random password.

On loading user profiles - The GP users are sent a link and login credentials over SMS required to login to the mGramSeva application. The link navigates to this screen and takes the user through the flow of logging in and resetting the password in case of first-time login.

The web link, too, initiates from the same screen.
