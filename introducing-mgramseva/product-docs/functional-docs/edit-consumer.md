## Edit Options

1. In case there are arrears, demand is generated. If there are no arrears, demand is not generated.
2. Users can modify the arrear value. In such a case, demand is generated with the updated value.
3. Users can add arrear to the connection, for which arrear was zero at the time of creating the connection. In such a case, new demand is generated.

Clicking on the Submit button shows a nudge saying **Details Submitted Successfully**. Closing the nudge navigates the user back to the home screen.

The CTA is activated only when any field is changed or updated. Else, it is in an inactive state.
