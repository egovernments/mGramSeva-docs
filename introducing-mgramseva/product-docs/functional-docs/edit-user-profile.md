1. Users can click on the hamburger menu from any screen. A slider from the left opens up.
2. Users are able to
   * Change Language
   * Edit profile
   * Logout
3. Changing language changes localization as per standards
4. Edit profile takes users to the next screen where changes can be made to the user profile
   * Name - Can be changed
   * Phone number - Cannot be changed
   * Gender - This field is not present by default. Whatever user enters is stored and saved
   * Email ID - It is an empty field. User input is stored as the user’s email id
   * Change Password - This takes users to the password changing screen where the old password, new password and confirm new password have to be entered as per given standards.
     * Dynamic password validation happens the same as in the registration flow.
     * Until all fields are entered, the primary CTA is disabled.
     * Changing the password shows a nudge to the user “Password updated successfully” and closing this nudge takes the user to the user profile screen.
   * Clicking on save shows a nudge to the user” Details saved successfully”. Upon closing, this user remains on the screen but the fields show as edited.
