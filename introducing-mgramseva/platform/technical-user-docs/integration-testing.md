# Integration Testing

## About Integration Testing

Integration testing (also called end-to-end testing or GUI testing) is used to simulate a user interacting with your app by doing things like clicking buttons, selecting items, scrolling items, etc.\
Integration testing is used to test how individual pieces work together as a whole or capture the performance of an application running on a real device.

We declared the integration\_test package in pubspec.yaml as shown in the img above.

* The test\_driver directory contains the integration\_test\_driver.dart file. (The folder structure is shown in image above). The integration driver is called from this file.
* The integration\_test directory contains the test script files of different screens. &#x20;
* The Test Inputs directory contains the test\_inputs.dart file. This file has the user actions inputs in json format. We can change user actions in this file.&#x20;

## **Integration Test Run**

There are two ways to start the integration testing**:**

* To run the integration test on virtual emulator / mobile, run the command on your terminal :\
  `cd ./frontend/mgramseva && flutter drive --driver=test_driver/integration_test_driver.dart`\
  `--target=integration_test/login_test.dart` ****&#x20;

(...or...)

* Go to `./frontend/mgramseva/utils/execute_integration.sh` and run the `execute_integration.sh` file on the virtual emulator / mobile. The integration test will start.
