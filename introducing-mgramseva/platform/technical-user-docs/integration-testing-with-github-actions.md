# Integration Testing With Github Actions

## **About Git Actions**

<img src="../../../.gitbook/assets/image (69).png" alt="" data-size="line">GitHub Actions enables you to create custom software development lifecycle workflows\
directly in your GitHub repository. This enables you to include Continuous Integration (CI) and continuous deployment (CD) capabilities. **It makes it** easier to automate how you build, test,\
and deploy your projects on any platform, including Linux, macOS, and Windows.&#x20;

Run your workflows in a virtual machine and local machine as well.

### **Why Use Git Action**

* It is easy to build the app in artefacts.
* Analyze, build, test and deploy our applications on any platform.
* Easily release the app bundle in the Play store.
* The speed of GitHub Actions is good.

* Every command will be written in yml files and all these files will be in .github/workflows/ directory of your repository, then only git will identify our script files.
* In our repository we are maintaining this file as main.yml, In this yml file we are executing the android drive job, which will run the integration testing scripts, once all the tests are passed then only it will build the app in QA ENV and store it in the artefacts as shown image.
* Explained every line of main.yml file with comments below.

```

# Trigger the workflow on push or pull requests.

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs.

## Integrating **S**elf-hosted Runners <a href="#integrating-self-hosted-runners" id="integrating-self-hosted-runners"></a>

### **About Self-hosted Runner**

We can host your own runners and customize the environment used to run jobs in your GitHub Actions workflows. Self-hosted runners can be physical, virtual, in a container, on-premises, or in a cloud.

With self-hosted runners, you can choose to create a custom hardware configuration with more processing power or memory to run larger jobs, install software available on your local network, and choose an operating system not offered by GitHub-hosted runners.

### **Integrating Self-hosted Runner With Local Machine**

* On [https://github.com/](https://github.com/) navigate to the main page of the repository.
* Under your repository name, click  **Settings** as shown in the image.![](<../../../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png>)
* In the left sidebar, click **Actions**.
* In the left sidebar, under "Actions", click **Runners**.
* Click **New self-hosted runner.**
* Select the operating system image and architecture of your self-hosted runner machine.
* You will see instructions showing you how to download the runner application and install it on your self-hosted runner machine.
* After completing the steps to add a self-hosted runner, the runner and its status are now listed under "Runners".
* Now you will have to edit the main.yaml file for using our local machine, replace the runs on with `self-hosted` as shown below.

`runs-on: ubuntu-latest` >> `runs-on: self-hosted`
